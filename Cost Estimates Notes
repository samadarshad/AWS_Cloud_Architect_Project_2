Initial cost: Approx $8600/month

With reduced budget:
The EC2 m5.4xlarge instance type costs approx $2800/month
- change EC2 type from m5.4xlarge to m5.large, but increase instance count from 8 to 10, this will mean smaller servers but greater number of instances to handle the low-cpu but high-frequency tasks in a social media platform.
- this reduced the bills by approx $2000/month, which makes the total to $6700/month
The S3 100TB/month with 20TB/month data transfer costs approx $4000/month
- change this to 75TB/month with 15TB/month outbound data transfer because the initial size needs are low for the number of users
- this reduced the bills by approx $1000/month, which makes the total to $5700/month
