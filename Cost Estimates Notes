Initial cost: Approx $8600/month

With reduced budget:
The EC2 costs approx $2800/month
- reduce EC2 type but increase instance count, this will mean smaller servers but greater number of instances to handle the low-cpu but high-frequency tasks in a social media platform.
- this reduced the bills by approx $2000/month, which makes the total to $6700/month
The S3 costs approx $4000/month
- reduce storage and transfer because the initial size needs are low for the number of users
- this reduced the bills by approx $1000/month, which makes the total to $5700/month

With increased budget:
The application can benefit most from:
- increased performance in server response times. Therefore increase EC2 instance type and quantity which raises costs by $2500/month, also increase transfer capacity of load balancers (+$400/month) and NAT gateway (+$2000/month).
- increased storage and data transfer capacity. Therefore increase S3 storage and transfer capacity which raises costs by $4000/month.
- increased database performance and capacity. Therefore increase RDS instance type, change to a 1-yr reserved instance and add storage, which raises costs by approx $3000/month.
